<strong style="color: #007acc;">Currently</strong>

PhD opportunities: Together with <a href="http://sites.unice.fr/site/raufaste/raufaste/index.html">Christophe Raufaste </a>, we are hiring a PhD student, starting in 2025, to work on the dynamics of liquid interfaces in the vicinity of rough surfaces.

Post-doc opportunities: No open position for now. But motivated young researchers can contact us and we will build together proposals to be sent to various local, national and/or international calls.

<strong style="color: #007acc;">In general</strong>

We are always looking for motivated students and young researchers to join our team. Do not hesitate to contact me for discussing possibilities at: ludovic[dot]keiser[at]univ-cotedazur[dot]fr
