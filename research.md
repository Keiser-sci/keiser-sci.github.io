Biofluids and Vascular Networks

A central focus of our research lies in the dynamics of fluid flow within vascular networks, with particular emphasis on plant xylem hydraulics under drought conditions. We investigate how air embolisms form and propagate in the vascular conduits of leaves, a process that can compromise water transport and ultimately lead to plant death.

To unravel this phenomenon, we develop biomimetic microfluidic models of xylem networks using soft, pervaporating PDMS channels. These systems replicate the hierarchical architecture and compliance of real veins and allow precise control over geometric and physical parameters. Through ultra-fast imaging, confocal microscopy, and interferometric pressure mapping, we reveal how embolisms propagate intermittently via a jerky, stop-and-go dynamics driven by elastocapillary effects at micrometric constrictions that mimic pit membranes.

In 2022, we established how a single constriction induces sudden embolism jumps due to nonlinear pressure build-up and release​. Building on this, we demonstrated in 2024 how networks of constrictions generate hierarchical and intermittent embolism propagation, mirroring observations in real Adiantum leaves​. We recently extended this work by coupling real-time pressure measurements and channel deformations, shedding light on the interplay between capillarity, compliance, and hydrodynamic resistance in complex vascular structures​.

On the theoretical side, we have introduced minimal models to capture nonlinear feedback between internal pressure and front dynamics in compliant networks, revealing history-dependent behaviors that cannot be explained by local thresholds alone​.

This interdisciplinary work, developed in close collaboration with plant physiologists, aims to provide quantitative insights into drought-induced hydraulic failure in leaves and inform traits-based predictions of plant vulnerability.
